                    <h5>Anatomy of a decision</h5>
<p>One of the most expensive capital expenditures a casino makes each year is the purchase of new slot machines. A mere forty games could easily fetch a whopping $1,000,000. So how do you decide which games to buy?</p>
<p>First, you all have information available through your slot system or other analytic software. You can rank them from most to least profitable by win or coin-in. That’s a start. Then by popularity you look at:</p>
<ol>
<li>Game Theme</li>
<li>Denomination</li>
<li>Manufacturer</li>
<li>Floor location</li>
<li>Percentage of floor</li>
<li>Cost</li>
</ol>
<p>As you all know, there are no guarantees when you spend three to four million dollars on slot machines that they are going to get played. So instead of putting all your eggs in one basket and buying all your games from one company, you spread your exposure over a wide net so you can mitigate the risk of flops and if you make a mistake it will be a small mistake and not a career ending mistake.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are trying something completely new, bring games in with small batches (four to six games) to prove themselves</li>
<li>Run trials if possible</li>
<li>Always ask for performance guarantees</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing is foolproof. But by strategically and systematically approaching your decision, you have narrowed the chance of failure and greatly improved the chance of it becoming successful.
The Mind has three distinctive functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking</li>
<li>Feeling</li>
<li>Wanting</li>
</ul>
<p>These three functions are very much related. They tell us why things are the way they are, measuring the good and the bad, and how to go about obtaining it. Hopefully by evaluating these functions, it allows us to make better choices and to avoid or minimize poor results.</p>
<p>However, nothing is foolproof. Some of the best learning methods are through trial and error. But if we learn nothing and continue to repeat the same mistakes that we have made previously, then we need only to look in the mirror to see why we continue to get poor results.</p>
<p>Business today is driven by Analytics. Whether consumer preference, marketing strategy, sports, or even dating. Just having statistics may still not be providing you with all the information you need to make better decisions. Most significant is making sure that you are analyzing the right information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have all the facts?</li>
<li>Are you interpreting them correctly?</li>
<li>Are you asking the right questions to begin with?</li>
<li>How does this change what you would do the next time?</li>
</ul>
<p>Too often having a bunch of numbers only gives us the chance to support our desired outcome. To tell our boss it was successful and, maybe even more damaging, about why we should do it again.
Begin with the End in Mind.</p>
<p>Many of you may have heard this phrase before. For those of you familiar with Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits books, this is my favorite of the seven. What does it mean, and how does it affect making decisions? When planning a project most people start with what the project will be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Prizes</li>
<li>Qualifications</li>
<li>Rules</li>
<li>Locations, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to start with the results. I want to know when this event/project/goal is over, what are we going to achieve? Revenue, policy and procedures, construction. What did I expect and what did I get?
Regardless of the project, if it was based on revenue, then that is the number I am starting with.
$50,000 When it is all said and done, I want $50,000 more than what we began with. In order to do that, I need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people need to attend?</li>
<li>How much money will they need to spend per person?</li>
<li>What are the prizes that I need to offer in order to get them to attend?</li>
<li>How do I invite them to get them to show up?</li>
<li>How do they qualify?</li>
<li>How do we staff it?</li>
<li>When do we have it so it doesn’t conflict with something else that’s going on?</li>
<li>What do I call it?</li>
</ul>
<p>By starting at the end, I have defined what I want to achieve and how to get there. As opposed to the beginning and hoping or accepting whatever the result will be.</p>
